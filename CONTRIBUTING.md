# Contributing to the Graph.Community Library
Thanks for considering making a contribution! Read over our guidelines and we will do our best to see your PRs merged successfully.

There are a few different recommended paths to get contributions into the released version of this library.

## File issues
The best way to get started with a contribution is to start a dialog with us. Sometimes features will be under development or out of scope for this library and it's best to check before starting work on contribution, especially for large work items.

## Pull requests
All pull requests should be submitted against the **prerelease** branch. The master branch is intended to represent the code released in the most-recent Nuget package.

When a new package is about to be released, changes in dev will be merged into master. The package will be generated from master.
