# Graph.Community Samples

The samples are implemented in separate classes. Each class uses common utility classes to manage configuration options and Http Request/Response logging.

The samples will require an application registration in [Azure Active Directory](https://aad.portal.azure.com). When creating the registration, select the option to treat the application as a public client.

Older samples use the [Device Code flow](https://aka.ms/msal-net-device-code-flow).

Refer to the notes below for the scopes required for each sample.

## Diagnostics sample

The diagnostics sample demonstrates how to capture diagnostic information from MSAL, diagnostics from the Graph.Community libary and use the LoggingMiddleware handler. The diagnostic sample also leverages the CommunityGraphClientFactory to properly setup the middleware handlers.

## SharePoint ChangeLog sample

> The functionality provided by the SharePoint ChangeLog is also available using Microsoft Graph + Delta query. More information is provided in this Tech Community Post: [How to retrieve complete set of permission changes while utilizing DeltaLinks (tokens) in SPO?](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/how-to-retrieve-complete-set-of-permission-changes-while/ba-p/1741127)

This sample will query the specified site (SP.Web), retrieving the current change token. The application will then pause, allowing for the user to update something in the site. Upon resuming, the application will retrieve all changes since the initial query.

Specify the site in the `ChangeLog.cs` file.

> **Scopes required**: https://[SharePointDomain].sharepoint.com/AllSites.FullControl
